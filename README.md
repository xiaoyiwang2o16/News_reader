# News_reader

## This is a Google Chrome extension that I created that displays News Articles Titles in a loop on a bar at the bottom of your screen.
This was created to be a quick way to be updated on the top news articles of the day without having to extensively take time to read over them.

### Clicking the button once allows for the bar to appear and clicking the button again makes the bar vanish.
Hovering over an article makes the loop stop.
Clicking on a specific article title takes you to the page of the article so that you can read it in depth.
